The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has invited Ms Jones most cordially to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

PronounNotice1PronounNotice2Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful."

Jones approaches the Viking Building entryway, the dramatic façade towering over her.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones peers upwards at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

&gt;[3] n
Jones takes a deep breath. "I'm going in."

Beck replies, "Be careful, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Above it floats, suspended on almost invisible cables, a giant crystal sculpture. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

&gt;[4] z
Before Jones gets a chance to do anything, two robot guards emerge from niches in the back wall! She dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring lifesigns."

&gt;[5] shoot art
(with the disruptor pistol)
Jones fires the disruptor into the sculpture's main support cable, snapping it. The huge crystal blob starts to sag, straining the other cables. In quick succession they break as well, and the whole installation plummets to the ground, right on top of the hapless guard robots.


Beck: "What was that crash? What's going on?"

Jones: "That, my friend, was what you'd call a work of art. Targets terminated."

Jones crosses the floor carefully, disruptor pistol at the ready.

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the ground floor. The centerpiece of this area is the actual Viking 2 lander, which landed right here on Utopia Planitia. The glass walls look out onto the city. She can go north or west from here.

&gt;[7] n

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

An indicator light glows green.

Jones: "I've unlocked the east side utility door."

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

&gt;[12] s

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the ground floor. The centerpiece of this area is the actual Viking 2 lander, which landed right here on Utopia Planitia. The glass walls look out onto the city. Jones can go north or west from here.

&gt;[13] w

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

&gt;[14] w
Jones crosses the floor carefully, disruptor pistol at the ready.

Galaxy Jones is at the southwest corner of the ground floor. A lush waterfall here contrasts with the dusty red streets of New Reykjavik beyond the glass walls. The ground floor extends north and east.

&gt;[15] n

Galaxy Jones is on the west side of the ground floor. Semicircular couches open on either side of a central carpeted path leading north and south. Set in the central pillar of the building to the east is a utility door. The city looms beyond the glass wall to the west.

Galaxy Jones is in the elevator room. This is a utility room related to the operation of the elevator, on the other side of the east wall here. There is a control panel on the wall, and a door leading west.

Hanging from a hook here is an elevator drop key.

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator hall. This hallway between the north and south ends of the ground floor is home to the elevator to the west. To the east is the entrance to a stairwell.

Jones inserts the elevator drop key into the drop key hole and turns it, disengaging the lock mechanism. Then she slides the door open.

Jones climbs into the elevator shaft

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator shaft. She is at the bottom of a dark well. Shining her suit light up, she can see that the elevator car is several floors up, unmoving. There is a ladder on the west wall.

        <result xml:space="preserve">(first opening the Cybernetica door)

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber".

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

She must have poked up her shoulder or something, for the guard robot fires his disruptor. The shot takes out a window on the east side of the room. The electrostatic field around the building keeps the atmosphere from pouring out.

Jones aims the pistol upward under the robot's enhanced armor. She flinches back when the robot's innards explode downward in a shower of sparks. It topples over, dead.

Jones: "Better than a video game. "

Beck: "Nice, but don't forget to credit your handler."

Jones: "Yes, yes, thanks for helping me not get killed."

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber". One of the windows along the east side of the office is broken.

Jones doffs the Atmo-Suit.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones peers upwards at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

Beck replies, "Be careful, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Above it floats, suspended on almost invisible cables, a giant crystal sculpture. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber".

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

Galaxy Jones is in the Inspiration Chamber. One of the most unique features of the office is the "inspiration chamber," a specialized room designed to stimulate creativity and innovation. The room is filled with advanced technology, including AI-generated art, interactive displays, and sensory stimulation devices that can help employees think outside the box and come up with new ideas.

Jones: "This is some real B.S. here."

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber". One of the windows along the east side of the office is broken.

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Above it floats, suspended on almost invisible cables, a giant crystal sculpture. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has invited Ms Jones most cordially to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230226 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has invited Ms Jones most cordially to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

Release 1 / Serial number 230226 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful."

The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has invited Ms Jones most cordially to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230227 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful."

The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has invited Ms Jones most cordially to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230227 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful."

The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has invited Ms Jones most cordially to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230227 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful."

The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has invited Ms Jones most cordially to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230226 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful."
