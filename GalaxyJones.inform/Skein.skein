The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken hostage the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has most cordially invited Ms Jones to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230311 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD


A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful.

"And one other thing, Jones: if you need help you can ASK BECK FOR HELP. You can also ASK BECK ABOUT things or ASK BECK ABOUT GAME for more information about the game. Finally, you can cause help to repeat from the beginning by saying ASK BECK TO RESET HELP"

        <result xml:space="preserve">Jones approaches the Viking Building entryway, the dramatic façade towering over her.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones peers upwards at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

Beck replies, "You got this, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above the center of the area, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Suddenly two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! She dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases. All this despite the fact that no one has turned up any evidence that Thallium served in any navy of any country on any planet. One can escape to the west or south.

Jones: "Now this is some choice bullshit here."

Beck: "Looks like the record of the good Admiral's long and dedicated service."

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities.

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

She takes off the Atmo-Suit.

Galaxy Jones is at the southwest corner of the Consolidated Microthings office. This looks like the IT area of the office. Numerous desks and an abundance of computer parts are here. Jones can go north or east from here.

There is a present with a note attached sitting on a desk here.

Galaxy Jones is in the elevator car. It's luxurious, with gold-plated walls and crystal lighting on the ceiling. The button panel is lacquered dark mahogany with what looks like real ivory buttons. The carpeting is soft and plush. A golden keyhole sits above the buttons.

The remains of the mauve guard robot are sprawled on the ground.

Galaxy Jones is in the southern corner of the penthouse. This must be Thallium's "treasure room", to go by the obscene display of wealth. The most notable feature is the array of diamonds lining the walls. Everything else here pales in comparison. The penthouse continues to the northwest, north, and northeast.

Thallium seems to speak from all around Jones. "You like diamonds, Jones? Of course you do -- they're a girl's best friend, after all."

Jones snorts, "Sure, Thallium."

Jones: "Hmm. This is made of glass."

Thallium: "Poor, sad Jones. But here's the thing. There is a real diamond in there; it's just you'll never find it before the building's defenses flood the whole floor with poisonous gas. Or maybe I'm bluffing. Maybe I'm not. Can you afford to gamble?"

Jones tosses the fake away.

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. Thallium's personal insignia, the ten planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam", is carved into the deep red wood outer wall, and inlaid with ebony. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something. Finally, there is something that looks like an electronic eye set into the inner wall. One may leave to the northeast or southeast.

A sound like a sliding door comes from behind Jones, and she spins around to see the red wall slide down into the floor. It exposes a control panel of sorts, featuring a large red button labeled "Press Me".

Galaxy Jones is in the northern corner of the penthouse. This is Thallium's bedroom. Apart from the expansive round bed in the center of the room, notable features include the line of dummies displaying his various suits of clothes, a large vanity table, and the complete lack of mirrors on the ceiling, thankfully. One may leave the room to the southwest, south, and southeast.

The elevator doors to the west are gold-plated. Sumptuous living quarters are visible to the north and south. A portion of the eastern wall has slid away to reveal a stunning white marble staircase.

Jones: "Must be the way up to the roof. Beck, you there?"

Beck: "Yep, I'm here, just a bit busy is all. I'll meet you on that roof."
