The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken hostage the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has most cordially invited Ms Jones to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230310 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD


A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful.

"And one other thing, Jones: if you need help you can ASK BECK FOR HELP. You can also ASK BECK ABOUT things or ASK BECK ABOUT GAME for more information about the game. Finally, you can cause help to repeat from the beginning by saying ASK BECK TO RESET HELP"

Galaxy Jones is next to the cage. The closely-set silnium bars seem to dash all hope of a rescue.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Jones tries the strength of the bars just in case. They don't budge.

South of the cage, Thallium crosses the roof to the flyer pad, where he boards the waiting flyer. The flyer lifts off and moves towards Jones.

Galaxy Jones is standing on the cage. The closely-set silnium bars seem to dash all hope of a rescue.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Thallium's flyer hovers over the rooftop. "Jones!"  he bellows. "Play time is over. I grow weary of your intransigence. In a moment this roof will be swarmed by guard robots -- of many different colors -- so many robots you couldn't possibly vandalize them all.  Say your prayers, Jones, or whatever you do when you're about to die."

Jones rolls her eyes.

A little ways off, a small red flyer aims for the rooftop and accelerates.

Jones attaches one end of the cable to the cage, and throws the other end up to the flyer where it hooks around the rail, then jumps off the cage to escape the aftermath. Seeing his flyer's predicament, Thallium jumps out of the flyer and disappears below the edge of the roof. The flyer reaches the end of its tether and slingshots downwards, slamming into side of the building.

The cage has tilted to the side, one attachment torn loose from the rooftop. Jones crawls into the cage to see to Europa Callisto.

"Europa! Can you hear me? I need you to move to get out of this cage. I can't carry you through that small opening. Europa!"

Europa moans but doesn't show any signs of having understood Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the cage. The whole structure is tilted, leaving a hole at the eastern end.

Jones is kneeling at Europa Callisto's side, trying to rouse her.

The red flyer, now recognizable as Galaxy's own, settles down onto the landing pad.

Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities.

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above the center of the area, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Suddenly two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! She dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

Jones: "Finally out of the shaft. That was quite a climb."

Beck: "This floor is just offices. Check the building management office to the west. It might have some useful stuff."

Galaxy Jones is in the ninth floor elevator hall. The elevator is to the west, the stairwell is to the east, and a corridor leads north and south. There is a bottled water vending machine here.

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

Beck replies, "You got this, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above the center of the area, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Suddenly two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! She dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

Galaxy Jones is in the southern corner of the penthouse. This must be Thallium's "treasure room", to go by the obscene display of wealth. The most notable feature is the array of diamonds lining the walls. Everything else here pales in comparison. The penthouse continues to the northwest, north, and northeast.

Thallium seems to speak from all around Jones. "You like diamonds, Jones? Of course you do -- they're a girl's best friend, after all."

Jones snorts, "Sure, Thallium."

Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities.

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

Galaxy Jones is next to the cage. The closely-set silnium bars seem to dash all hope of a rescue.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Jones tries the strength of the bars just in case. They don't budge.

South of the cage, Thallium crosses the roof to the flyer pad, where he boards the waiting flyer. The flyer lifts off and moves towards Jones.

It doesn't seem useful to attach the cable to this part of the cage.

Thallium's flyer hovers over the rooftop. "Jones!"  he bellows. "Play time is over. I grow weary of your intransigence. In a moment this roof will be swarmed by guard robots -- of many different colors -- so many robots you couldn't possibly vandalize them all.  Say your prayers, Jones, or whatever you do when you're about to die."

Jones rolls her eyes.

A little ways off, a small red flyer aims for the rooftop and accelerates.

The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken hostage the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has most cordially invited Ms Jones to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230309 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD


A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful.

"And one other thing, Jones: if you need help you can ASK BECK FOR HELP. You can also ASK BECK ABOUT things or ASK BECK ABOUT GAME for more information about the game. Finally, you can cause help to repeat from the beginning by saying ASK BECK TO RESET HELP"

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the tenth floor. Instead of a window, there's what appears to be an exhaust vent.

Jones: "Alright, I'm by the tenth floor now. What's this grill thing here?"

Beck: "That's an exhaust vent. There's an air handling room on this floor which it leads into. If you can get the cover off you should be able to access the whole floor from here."

Thallium seems to speak from all around Jones. "You like diamonds, Jones? Of course you do -- they're a girl's best friend, after all."

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. Thallium's personal insignia, the ten planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam", is carved into the deep red wood outer wall, and inlaid with ebony. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something. Finally, there is something that looks like an electronic eye set into the inner wall. One may leave to the northeast or southeast.

Jones walks out onto the luxurious penthouse roof. Admiral Thallium turns from the railing to face her. He is dressed in an absurd elaboration of a Martian Admiral's uniform. He looks Jones up and down with a lecherous leer. "Ah, Galaxy Jones, as lovely as ever. If it weren't so unbearably cliché I'd ask you to join me in my rise to greatness. But alas, you are too habituated to the smug high of 'goodness'." He sighs dramatically. "We've trodden similar ground before; no need to discuss it further. Although I would challenge any of your various amoureux to conjugate 'tread' correctly.

"Anyway, I guess this is the time where you do something predictably undignified and violent. Before you do I feel I should inform you that your sidearm has been rendered quite ineffective by my personal security field. But do go ahead and try it."

Jones sneers. "I wouldn't give you the satisfaction," she says, looking around. "I see you don't have any of your robot pets up here. How are you going to stop me from rescuing Europa?"

"Oh please, while we're trying things, try that too. I wish you luck breaking the silnium bars of the cage."

"What's silnium?"

"A superstrong material invented here in my Martian Chemical laboratory. We had a press conference for it -- weren't you watching?"

"Couldn't be bothered."

"Oh for frotz sake, Jones, you're so frustrating!"

Thallium turns his back on Jones and stares out over the city.

Galaxy Jones is on the penthouse roof. It is an extravagant and opulent space, designed to showcase Thallium's wealth and power. Much of the rooftop is devoted to an outdoor lounge area, with comfortable seating and a fire pit, centered around a hot tub and flanked by a bar. All around is the city of New Reykjavik, and beyond that the red Martian landscape. Around the entirety of the roof is an electrostatic field designed to keep air in and particulates out. To the north is a large cage, and to the west is a landing pad. Jones can distantly see a woman lying on the floor of the cage. A green and black flyer sits on the landing pad.

Admiral Thallium is sulking.

Galaxy Jones is in the southern corner of the penthouse. This must be Thallium's "treasure room", to go by the obscene display of wealth. The most notable feature is the array of diamonds lining the walls. Everything else here pales in comparison. The penthouse continues to the northwest, north, and northeast.

Thallium seems to speak from all around Jones. "You like diamonds, Jones? Of course you do -- they're a girl's best friend, after all."

Jones snorts, "Sure, Thallium."

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. Thallium's personal insignia, the ten planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam", is carved into the deep red wood outer wall, and inlaid with ebony. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something. Finally, there is something that looks like an electronic eye set into the inner wall. One may leave to the northeast or southeast.

Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above the center of the area, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Suddenly two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! She dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

Galaxy Jones is in the northern corner of the penthouse. This is Thallium's bedroom. Apart from the expansive round bed in the center of the room, notable features include the line of dummies displaying his various suits of clothes, a large vanity table, and the complete lack of mirrors on the ceiling, thankfully. One may leave the room to the southwest, south, and southeast.

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. Thallium's personal insignia, the ten planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam", is carved into the deep red wood outer wall, and inlaid with ebony. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something. Finally, there is something that looks like an electronic eye set into the inner wall. One may leave to the northeast or southeast.
