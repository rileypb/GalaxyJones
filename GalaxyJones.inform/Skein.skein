The phone rings. Galaxy Jones, the solar system's greatest hero, rolls over in bed and presses the talk button.

"Yes?" she says in a voice thick with sleep.

"Hello, is this Galaxy Jones?" comes the voice from the speaker.

"Yes, this is she. To whom am I speaking?"

"Oh, hi, Ms Jones. This is Patty, I work for Admiral P. X. Thallium, CEO of Diversified Entanglements, LLC. He asked me to forward a message to you."

"He did, did he? Now what would the Admiral want to say to me?"

"Oh, it's not from the Admiral himself. It's from one Miss Europa Callisto. I must say, the Admiral was quite surprised when I said I didn't know who she is. Apparently she's famous."

"Yes, quite famous, but why would she send a message to me, and why on Mars would she send it through Thallium? But never mind, what's the message?"

Patty can be heard rustling paper. "Let's see... it's here somewhere. Oh yes, here it is. The message is 'Help.'"

Ten minutes later, Galaxy Jones, in her speeder Galaxy One, races across the desolate expanse of Utopia Planitia, Mars. Her nemesis, the thoroughly execrable Admiral Thallium, has taken the exquisite Europa Callisto, singer and actress renowned throughout a dozen solar systems, hostage. As Patty has quite helpfully explained, Miss Callisto is imprisoned at the top of the Viking Building in New Reykjavik, guarded by an impressive number of killer robots and other diabolical instruments of Jones's inevitable demise. The Admiral has most cordially invited Ms Jones to break into his building and attempt a rescue.

"Oh I will," Galaxy mutters to herself. This time, she vows silently, Thallium won't escape.

Plus she'll get to meet Europa Callisto. That'll be totally sweet.

An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230305 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD


A sleek dark red speeder roars into the dock of the Viking Building. A tall, strong woman in a battle-ready jumpsuit climbs out of it: Galaxy Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

Jones's handler Beck comes over her headset. "Alright, what's going on?"

She replies, "I'm in the speeder dock. No movement. What can I expect inside?"

"Blueprints show the ground floor is one big empty space with elevators in the center. Not a lot of places for resistance to hide, but you can never tell. Be careful."

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones peers upwards at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above it, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases.

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the ground floor. The centerpiece of this area is the actual Viking 2 lander, which landed right here on Utopia Planitia. The glass walls look out onto the city. Jones can go north or west from here.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber".

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

Beck: "Get closer. Keep your head down, but follow it until you can get a good shot in."

She must have poked up her shoulder or something, for the guard robot fires his disruptor. The shot takes out a window on the east side of the room. The electrostatic field around the building keeps the atmosphere from pouring out.

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber".

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

She must have poked up her shoulder or something, for the guard robot fires his disruptor. The shot takes out a window on the east side of the room. The electrostatic field around the building keeps the atmosphere from pouring out.

Galaxy Jones is in the Inspiration Chamber. One of the most unique features of the office is the "inspiration chamber," a specialized room designed to stimulate creativity and innovation. The room is filled with advanced technology, including AI-generated art, interactive displays, and sensory stimulation devices that can help employees think outside the box and come up with new ideas.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the tenth floor. Instead of a window, there's what appears to be an exhaust vent. If it's for forced air, though, the fan is currently not running. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Jones: "Alright, I'm by the tenth floor now. What's this grill thing here?"

Beck: "That's an exhaust vent. There's an air handling room on this floor which it leads into. If you can get the cover off you should be able to access the whole floor from here."

Galaxy Jones is in the air handling room. There is a good amount of loud fans and other air handling machinery here. A small hinged vent opening leads into some ductwork, and from there to the outside. A door leads west.

She takes off the Atmo-Suit.

Jones: "Ha! I'm in!"

Beck: "Be careful, you're likely to run into more resistance here. The floor is all one open office, so any guard robots will have good line of sight."

Jones: "Got it."

Jones approaches the Viking Building entryway, the dramatic façade towering over her.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones peers upwards at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

&gt;[9] n
Jones takes a deep breath. "I'm going in."

Beck replies, "You got this, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above it, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

&gt;[10] z
Before Jones gets a chance to do anything, two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! She dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

&gt;[11] shoot art
Jones fires the disruptor into the sculpture's main support cable, snapping it. The huge crystal blob starts to sag, straining the other cables. In quick succession they break as well, and the whole installation plummets to the ground, right on top of the hapless guard robots.

Beck: "What was that crash? What's going on?"

Jones: "That, my friend, was what you'd call a work of art. Targets terminated."

Jones digs through the ruins and finds a cable with hooks at either end, which she takes.

Jones crosses the floor carefully, disruptor pistol at the ready.

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the ground floor. The centerpiece of this area is the actual Viking 2 lander, which landed right here on Utopia Planitia. The glass walls look out onto the city. She can go north or west from here.

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases. All this despite the fact that no one has turned up any evidence that Thallium served in any navy of any country on any planet. One can escape to the west or south.

&gt;[22] x medals

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

&gt;[36] n

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator hall. This hallway between the north and south ends of the ground floor is home to the elevator to the west. To the east is the entrance to a stairwell.

&gt;[37] use drop key with elevator

Jones inserts the elevator drop key into the drop key hole and turns it, disengaging the lock mechanism. Then she slides the door open.

Jones climbs into the elevator shaft

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator shaft. She is at the bottom of a dark well. Shining her suit light up, she can see that the elevator car is several floors up, unmoving. There is a ladder running up the wall next to the door.

Jones reaches for the screwdriver, but she fumbles it and it rolls off the back of the filing cabinet.

Jones: "Damn."

Beck: "What? What's going on?"

Jones: "Just being clumsy is all."

&gt;[55] look behind cabinet
(taking the screwdriver)
Jones reaches behind the cabinet to retrieve the screwdriver. A swipe and a hiss make her recoil.

Jones: "Holy --!"

Beck: "What now?"

Jones: "There's a cat here! Behind a filing cabinet. Gotta get behind there to get a screwdriver, so I need a way to drive off the cat."

&gt;[56] drop shrimp
Sensing food, the black cat pokes its head out, grabs the shrimp in its jaws, and races off.

Jones approaches the Viking Building entryway, the dramatic façade towering over her.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones peers upwards at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

&gt;[8] n
Jones takes a deep breath. "I'm going in."

Beck replies, "You got this, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above it, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

&gt;[9] z
Before Jones gets a chance to do anything, two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! She dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

&gt;[10] shoot art
Jones fires the disruptor into the sculpture's main support cable, snapping it. The huge crystal blob starts to sag, straining the other cables. In quick succession they break as well, and the whole installation plummets to the ground, right on top of the hapless guard robots.

Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator hall. This hallway between the north and south ends of the ground floor is home to the elevator to the west. To the east is the entrance to a stairwell.

&gt;[36] use drop key with elevator

Jones inserts the elevator drop key into the drop key hole and turns it, disengaging the lock mechanism. Then she slides the door open.

Jones: "Finally out of the shaft. That was quite a climb."

Beck: "This floor is just offices. Check the building management office to the west. It might have some useful stuff."

Galaxy Jones is in the ninth floor elevator hall. The elevator is to the west, the stairwell is to the east, and a corridor leads north and south. There is a bottled water vending machine here.

Galaxy Jones is at the north end of the building management office. The building management office is a bunch of desks and task boards. There is a particularly large desk against the west window. The office exit is to the east, and the office continues to the south.

&gt;[50] pick desk lock with pin
Jones pushes the pin into the keyhole and wiggles it around. After a few seconds of this the desk drawer pops open. It contains a black cardkey.

Galaxy Jones is at the south end of the building management office. The building management office is a bunch of desks and task boards. There is a filing cabinet against the east wall. The office exit is to the east, and the office continues to the north.

A screwdriver sits atop the filing cabinet.

&gt;[53] take screwdriver
Jones reaches for the screwdriver, but she fumbles it and it rolls off the back of the filing cabinet.

Jones: "Damn."

Beck: "What? What's going on?"

Jones: "Just being clumsy is all."

&gt;[54] look behind cabinet
(taking the screwdriver)
Jones reaches behind the cabinet to retrieve the screwdriver. A swipe and a hiss make her recoil.

Jones: "Holy --!"

Beck: "What now?"

Jones: "There's a cat here! Behind a filing cabinet. Gotta get behind there to get a screwdriver, so I need a way to drive off the cat."

&gt;[55] drop shrimp
Sensing food, the black cat pokes its head out, grabs the shrimp in its jaws, and races off.

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber".

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

&gt;[64] sneak up on robot
Jones creeps a little ways toward the guard robot.

&gt;[65] sneak up on robot
Slowly, slowly, Jones gets a little closer. Just a little more...

She must have poked up her shoulder or something, for the guard robot fires his disruptor. The shot takes out a window on the east side of the room. The electrostatic field around the building keeps the atmosphere from pouring out.

&gt;[66] sneak up on robot
Jones is right up next to the robot, crouched beneath a desk. She'll never get a better shot.

&gt;[67] shoot robot
Jones aims the pistol upward under the robot's enhanced armor and fires. She flinches back when the robot's innards explode downward in a shower of sparks. It topples over, dead.

Galaxy Jones is in the Inspiration Chamber. One of the most unique features of the office is the "inspiration chamber," a specialized room designed to stimulate creativity and innovation. The room is filled with advanced technology, including AI-generated art, interactive displays, and sensory stimulation devices that can help employees think outside the box and come up with new ideas.

Galaxy Jones is on a ledge. She's plastered up against the wall, trying not to look down.

&gt;[71] look down
Jones is afraid of heights.

&gt;[72] look down
Really, really afraid of heights.

&gt;[73] look down
Okay, fine. Jones look down, slowly, slowly... and there's a window cleaner's scaffold, about six feet below her.

Jones: "Okay, so. There's a window washing platform right below me. I might be able to drop down to it, but I won't be able to get back up."

Beck: "Take it easy, Jones."

Jones drops off the ledge onto the scaffold. It rocks unnervingly for a moment.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the eighth floor window. There doesn't seem to be any way to get into the building here. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the tenth floor. Instead of a window, there's what appears to be an exhaust vent. If it's for forced air, though, the fan is currently not running. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Jones: "Alright, I'm by the tenth floor now. What's this grill thing here?"

Beck: "That's an exhaust vent. There's an air handling room on this floor which it leads into. If you can get the cover off you should be able to access the whole floor from here."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above it, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases. All this despite the fact that no one has turned up any evidence that Thallium served in any navy of any country on any planet. One can escape to the west or south.

Jones reaches behind the cabinet to retrieve the screwdriver. A swipe and a hiss make her recoil.

Jones: "Holy --!"

Beck: "What now?"

Jones: "There's a cat here! Behind a filing cabinet. Gotta get behind there to get a screwdriver, so I need a way to drive off the cat."

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities. At the south end of the room is a door labeled "Inspiration Chamber".

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

She takes off the Atmo-Suit.

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. Thallium's personal insignia, the nine planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam", is carved into the deep red wood outer wall, and inlaid with ebony. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something. Finally, there is something that looks like an electronic eye set into the inner wall. One may leave to the northeast or southeast.

Jones opens the door and steps through onto the roof. The door crashes shut, and a lock audibly clicks.


Jones walks out onto the luxurious penthouse roof. Admiral Thallium turns from the railing to face her. He is dressed in an absurd elaboration of a Martian Admiral's uniform. He looks Jones up and down with a lecherous leer. "Ah, Galaxy Jones, as lovely as ever. If it weren't so unbearably cliché I'd ask you to join me in my rise to greatness. But alas, you are too habituated to the smug high of 'goodness'." He sighs dramatically. "We've trodden similar ground before; no need to discuss it further. Although I would challenge any of your various amoureux to conjugate 'tread' correctly.

"Anyway, I guess this is the time where you do something predictably undignified and violent. Before you do I feel I should inform you that your sidearm has been rendered quite ineffective by my personal security field. But do go ahead and try it."

Jones sneers. "I wouldn't give you the satisfaction," she says, looking around. "I see you don't have any of your robot pets up here. How are you going to stop me from rescuing Europa?"

"Oh please, while we're trying things, try that too. I wish you luck breaking the silnium bars of the cage."

"What's silnium?"

"A superstrong material invented here in my Martian Chemical laboratory. We had a press conference for it -- weren't you watching?"

"Couldn't be bothered."

"Oh for frotz sake, Jones, you're so frustrating!"

Thallium turns his back on Jones and stares out over the city.

Galaxy Jones is on the penthouse roof. It is an extravagant and opulent space, designed to showcase Thallium's wealth and power. Much of the rooftop is devoted to an outdoor lounge area, with comfortable seating and a fire pit, centered around a hot tub and flanked by a bar. All around is the city of New Reykjavik, and beyond that the red Martian landscape. Around the entirety of the roof is an electrostatic field designed to keep air in and particulates out. To the north is a large cage, and to the west is a landing pad. Jones can distantly see a woman lying on the floor of the cage. A green and black flyer sits on the landing pad.

Admiral Thallium is sulking.

Galaxy Jones is next to the cage. The closely-set silnium bars seem to dash all hope of a rescue.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Jones tries the strength of the bars just in case. They don't budge.

South of the cage, Thallium crosses the roof to the flyer pad, where he boards the waiting flyer. The flyer lifts off and moves towards Jones.

Thallium's flyer hovers over the rooftop. "Jones!"  he bellows. "Play time is over. I grow weary of your intransigence. In a moment this roof will be swarmed by guard robots -- of many different colors -- so many robots you couldn't possibly vandalize them all.  Say your prayers, Jones, or whatever you do when you're about to die."

Jones rolls her eyes.

A little ways off, a small red flyer aims for the rooftop and accelerates.

Jones throws the cable up to the flyer where it hooks around the rail, and attaches the other end to the cage, then jumps off the cage to escape the aftermath. Seeing his flyer's predicament, Thallium jumps through the door and disappears below the edge of the roof. The flyer reaches the end of its tether and slingshots downwards, slamming into side of the building.

The cage has tilted to the side, one attachment torn loose from the rooftop. Jones crawls into the cage to see to Europa Callisto.

"Europa! Can you hear me? I need you to move to get out of this cage. I can't carry you through that small opening. Europa!"

Europa moans but doesn't show any signs of having understood Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the cage. The whole structure is tilted, leaving a hole at the eastern end.

Jones is kneeling at Europa Callisto's side, trying to rouse her.

The red flyer, now recognizable as Galaxy's own, settles down onto the landing pad.

Jones nods, but says "We'll have time for introductions later. We have to get out of here before the roof is full of killer robots. Can you crawl? If you can get through that hole I can carry you the rest of the way."

Europa nods. "I think so."

Galaxy Jones helps her through the hole in the cage, then gently picks her up and jogs toward the waiting flyer. Beck's familiar face appears at the door of the aircraft, urging her on.

Not so far away, Admiral Thallium crawls back over the edge of  the roof. As he pulls himself up, he aims a pistol at Jones's back...

...and she falls sprawling on the landing pad, Europa Callisto tumbling from her arms. Beck is by Callisto's side in a moment, lifting her and carrying her into the flyer.

And then the robots swarm the roof like a mechanical rainbow tide. By the time Beck returns to the door it is already too late. A group of robots surrounds Jones, while another robot carries Thallium triumphantly. Beck has no choice but to take off, leaving Jones behind, not knowing if she still lives...

&lt;Black screen&gt;

"Jones! Jones! Wake up! I'm trying to talk to you!"

&lt;Cut to a shot of two closed eyes&gt;

"C'mon, open those eyes."

&lt;The shot widens to show Galaxy Jones, the Solar System's greatest hero, flat on the floor, seemingly unconscious&gt;

"This is getting tiresome, Jones. Stop playing dead."

Her eyes flutter open, close again, then open. She winces and brings one hand up to shield her eyes. "Who's that?" she says, hoarsely.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I might get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Jones presses the button, and the scaffold begins to descend.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the ninth floor window. She could climb back into the building through the window here. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the tenth floor. Instead of a window, there's what appears to be an exhaust vent. If it's for forced air, though, the fan is currently not running. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.
