Book 1 - Ground Floor

Chapter 1 -  Speeder Dock

The description of the speeder dock is "A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone fa√ßade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.".

The speeder-vehicle is a fixed in place thing in the speeder dock. It is privately-named. The printed name is "speeder". Understand "speeder/vehicle/car/landspeeder/galaxy/one" as speeder-vehicle. "[Our] speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays."

Some windows are part of the speeder-vehicle. The description is "The tint is too dark to see through.".

Some turbines are part of the speeder-vehicle. The description is "The engines cause [us] to recoil from the waves of heat rolling off of them." Understand "engines/thrusters/turbine/engine/thruster" as turbines.
 
Some wings are part of the speeder-vehicle. The description is "Not technically necessary as the speeder works via anti-gravity, the blade-like wings nonetheless give the vehicle a certain flair unobtainable by any other means.".

Instead of entering the speeder-vehicle:
	say "You have a job to do here.";

The building entryway is a backdrop. It is in the speeder dock, entry doorway, and lobby. "[If the location is the lobby]The entryway (exit actually) leads out to the speeder dock.[otherwise]The entryway is dominated by the towering fa√ßade of a Viking king, namesake of the building itself.". Understand "entry/doorway/entrance/entranceway" as building entryway. Understand "exit" as building entryway when the location is the lobby.
	
Chapter 2 - Building Entryway

The description of the entry door is "A glass revolving door emblazoned with the symbol of a Viking kind astride the planet Mars."

Chapter 3 - Lobby

The description of the lobby is "The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water installations, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Above it floats suspended a giant crystal sculpture.".

The front desk is scenery in the lobby. It is a pseudocontainer. The contents description is "There's not much on the desk other than a note that says '82436'.". "There is nothing of interest on the front desk."

The giant sculpture is scenery in the lobby. Understand "art/artwork/Rambutan/glass/crystal/monstrosity" as the giant sculpture. "It's a huge crystal abstraction, provocative in its arrogance but evocative of nothing. A typical public installation by the artist Rambutan."
	
Report shooting a guard robot with the disruptor pistol:
	say "[one of]Oops, [we] [miss][or][We] [stick] [our] head out from behind the desk and squeeze off a shot at [the noun]. In [our] haste it goes wide of the target[or]A barrage of fire from the robots prevents [us] from firing[or]Oof. Big miss[at random]. [run paragraph on]";
	
Check shooting something with the disruptor pistol:
	if the noun is not a guard robot and the noun is not the giant sculpture:
		say "Shooting that would accomplish nothing.";
	
The tangled ruin is a fixed in place pseudocontainer. "Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots." Understand "remains/sculpture/glass/guard/robots/robot/red/green" as the tangled ruin. 
The description is "You search some more, but nothing further turns up."
The contents description is "You dig through the ruins and find a thingy, which you take."
The tangled ruin is auto-take.
The thingy is in the tangled ruin.
	
Carry out shooting the giant sculpture with the disruptor pistol:
	say "[italic type][We] [fire] the disruptor into the sculpture's main support cable, snapping it. The huge crystal blob starts to sag, straining the other cables. In quick succession they break as well, and the whole installation plummets to the ground, right on top of the hapless guard robots.[roman type][paragraph break]";
	remove the red guard robot from play;
	remove the green guard robot from play;
	remove the giant sculpture from play;
	move the tangled ruin to the lobby;
	increase the score by 1;
