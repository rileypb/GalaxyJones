>l
Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

>x speeders
There's nothing like that nearby.

>x speeder
(the speeder)
Galaxy One is a Dust Runner, a top-of-the-line model from Olympus Speedworks. It's deep crimson with tinted windows. Powerful turbines adorn vestigial wings that sweep back in severe rearward arcs.

>x sky
There's nothing like that nearby.

>x viking
The entryway is dominated by the towering façade of a Viking king, namesake of the building itself.

>n
Jones approaches the Viking Building entryway, the dramatic façade towering over her.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones looks up at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

>enter
You must supply a noun.

>enter building
Jones takes a deep breath. "I'm going in."

Beck replies, "You got this, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above the center of the area, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

>x sculpture
Suddenly two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! Jones dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

>shoot green robot
Jones's shot goes wide, reflecting off one of the building struts and into the suspended sculpture. The artwork begins to spin wildly, straining its cables.

Beck: "Robot on your right!"

One robot tries to flank her, but a shot from her disruptor sends it scurrying back.

>crawl east
I didn't understand that sentence.

>e
Trying to reach an exit would surely get Jones shot.

Jones: "I'm pinned down here!"

One of the robots fires directly above her head.

>shoot sculpture
Jones fires the disruptor into the sculpture's main support cable, snapping it. The huge crystal blob starts to sag, straining the other cables. In quick succession they break as well, and the whole installation plummets to the ground, right on top of the hapless guard robots.

Beck: "What was that crash? What's going on?"

Jones: "That, my friend, was what you'd call a work of art. Targets terminated."

>* lol, love the logo repreis
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

>x niche
Aside from a robot charging station, there's nothing here.

>get charging station
I only understood you as far as wanting to get the charging stations.

>w
Jones crosses the floor carefully, disruptor pistol at the ready.

Galaxy Jones is at the southwest corner of the ground floor. A lush indoor waterfall here contrasts with the dusty red streets of New Reykjavik beyond the glass walls. The ground floor extends north and east.

Admiral Thallium's voice booms from the ceiling. "Little Galaxy thinks she's beaten the big bad Admiral. Sorry dear, that was only a taste."

>l
Galaxy Jones is at the southwest corner of the ground floor. A lush indoor waterfall here contrasts with the dusty red streets of New Reykjavik beyond the glass walls. The ground floor extends north and east.

>x waterfall
The waterfall descends the length of an artificial rock formation fringed by wide-leaved Earth plants and ferns. The water collects in a basin at the bottom, where it begins its journey again. A single coin sits on the bottom of the basin.

Jones: "One coin? Not very generous people around here."

>get coin
Taken.

>n

Galaxy Jones is on the west side of the ground floor. Semicircular couches open on either side of a central carpeted path leading north and south. Set in the central pillar of the building to the east is a utility door. The city looms beyond the glass wall to the west.

>x utility door
It's a white metal door, completely typical. It has a swipe card lock right above the handle.

>n

Galaxy Jones is at the northwest corner of the ground floor. A large relief map of Mars is mounted on the north wall here. One can leave here to the south or east.

>x map
The map is crafted of bronze and sports a star at the site of New Reykjavik.

>get star
That seems to be a part of the large relief map of Mars.

>e

Galaxy Jones is on the north side of the ground floor. The area is dominated by a towering statue of Admiral Thallium against the north wall. The ground floor extends west and east from here. The elevator is to the south.

>x statue
His nauseating visage seems to leer at Jones, and she suppresses a shiver of disgust.

Jones groans. "Be glad you're not here, Beck. This is revolting."

Beck chuckles. "I won't ask."

>break statue
Jones only uses violent means when absolutely necessary.

>e

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases. All this despite the fact that no one has turned up any evidence that Thallium served in any navy of any country on any planet. One can escape to the west or south.

Jones: "Now this is some choice bullshit here."

Beck: "Looks like the record of the good Admiral's long and dedicated service."

>x medals
Jones yawns looking over the assortment of faux honors. They're all behind glass, but one of the display cases is partly open, leaving the rather garish medal inside unprotected.

>get medal
Taken.

>break glass
Jones only uses violent means when absolutely necessary.

>s

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

Beck: "Blueprints indicate a closet to the west of you. Might be useful."

>get canape
There are so many things on the table. Jones might want to look at them and decide what she wants.

>x table
The table is covered with a wide array of treats from the ridiculously expensive, such as shrimp tea sandwiches (where do you get shrimp on Mars?), to the just plain ridiculous, like poached ostrich eggs in jelly. A good number of forks are laid out to one side.

Jones: "What would you like me to bring you, Beck? Shrimp tea sandwiches, or poached ostrich eggs?"

Beck: "Oh, the shrimp. Definitely get the shrimp."

>get shrimp
Taken.

>get fork
Taken.

>get egg
Don't even.

>w
(first opening the closet door)
Jones will have to enter the correct code on the keypad first.

>x closet door
A typical white metal utility door. Next to it is a keypad with the digits 0-9. An indicator light glows red.

>s

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the ground floor. The centerpiece of this area is the actual Viking 2 lander, which landed right here on Utopia Planitia. The glass walls look out onto the city. Jones can go north or west from here.

>x lander
The lander is such a big, ungainly object it's hard to imagine it was once a pinnacle of human achievement.

>open lander
It isn't something Jones can open.

As soon as Jones enters the stairwell, a disruptor blast from above zings past her shoulder, and she beats a hasty retreat. She won't be going up the stairs until she can clear out the resistance, and she can't do that from here.

Jones: "I've got gunfire from somewhere up the stairs. I'll have to get above them and take them out from behind."

Beck: "Sounds like a plan."

Looking down at New Reykjavik, one can trace the history of the city, as it expanded radially from its original domes, the multiple frontiers colliding and interfering like ripples in a pond, until eventually, the map gave way to rectangular regularity.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that.

Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities.

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I can get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the tenth floor. Instead of a window, there's what appears to be an exhaust vent. If it's for forced air, though, the fan is currently not running. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Jones: "Alright, I'm by the tenth floor now. What's this grille thing here?"

Beck: "That's an exhaust vent. There's an air handling room on this floor which it leads into. If you can remove the cover you should be able to access the whole floor from here."

Jones loosens the screws with the screwdriver and opens the grille.

Jones climbs inside the vent, crawls along a short length of ductwork, and emerges through another hinged grille, into the air handling room.

The most notable feature is the array of diamonds lining the walls. Everything else here pales in comparison. The penthouse continues to the northwest, north, and northeast.

Thallium seems to speak from all around Jones. "You like diamonds, Jones? Of course you do -- they're a girl's best friend, after all."

Jones snorts, "Sure, Thallium."

>x diamonds
So many of them, from the tiny to the obscenely large. It looks like it wouldn't be hard to pry one out.

Thallium: "Poor, sad Jones. But here's the thing. There is a real diamond in there; it's just you'll never find it before the building's defenses flood the whole floor with poisonous gas. Or maybe I'm bluffing. Maybe I'm not. Can you afford to gamble?"

As soon as insert the diamond into the claw, laser beams spring from five emitters on the walls. They hit the diamond and join into a single more powerful beam that strikes the electronic eye on the wall. A sound like a sliding door comes from behind Jones, and she spins around to see the red wall slide down into the floor. It exposes a control panel of sorts, featuring a large red button labeled "Press Me".

Jones walks out onto the luxurious penthouse roof. Admiral Thallium turns from the railing to face her. He is dressed in an absurd elaboration of a Martian Admiral's uniform. He looks Jones up and down with a lecherous leer. "Ah, Galaxy Jones, as lovely as ever. If it weren't so unbearably cliché I'd ask you to join me in my rise to greatness. But alas, you are too habituated to the smug high of 'goodness'." He sighs dramatically. "We've trodden similar ground before; no need to discuss it further. Although I would challenge any of your various amoureux to conjugate 'tread' correctly.

"Anyway, I guess this is the time where you do something predictably undignified and violent. Before you do I feel I should inform you that your sidearm has been rendered quite ineffective by my personal security field. But do go ahead and try it."

Jones sneers. "I wouldn't give you the satisfaction," she says, looking around. "I see you don't have any of your robot pets up here. How are you going to stop me from rescuing Europa?"

"Oh please, while we're trying things, try that too. I wish you luck breaking the silnium bars of the cage."

"What's silnium?"

"A superstrong material invented here in my Martian Chemical laboratory. We had a press conference for it -- weren't you watching?"

"Couldn't be bothered."

"Oh for frotz sake, Jones, you're so frustrating!"

Thallium turns his back on Jones and stares out over the city.

Galaxy Jones is on the penthouse roof. It is an extravagant and opulent space, designed to showcase Thallium's wealth and power. Much of the rooftop is devoted to an outdoor lounge area, with comfortable seating and a fire pit, centered around a hot tub and flanked by a bar. All around is the city of New Reykjavik, and beyond that the red Martian landscape. Around the entirety of the roof is an electrostatic field designed to keep air in and particulates out. To the north is a large cage, and to the west is a landing pad. Jones can distantly see a woman lying on the floor of the cage. A green and black flyer sits on the landing pad.

Admiral Thallium is sulking.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Jones tries the strength of the bars just in case. They don't budge.

South of the cage, Thallium crosses the roof to the flyer pad, where he boards the waiting flyer. The flyer lifts off and moves towards Jones.

>shoot flyer
Jones's disruptor does nothing. Looks like Thallium was telling the truth.

Thallium's flyer hovers over the rooftop. "Jones!"  he bellows. "Play time is over. I grow weary of your intransigence. In a moment this roof will be swarmed by guard robots -- of many different colors -- so many robots you couldn't possibly vandalize them all.  Say your prayers, Jones, or whatever you do when you're about to die."

Jones rolls her eyes.

A little ways off, another flyer, small and red, aims for the rooftop and accelerates.

Galaxy Jones is on the penthouse roof. It is an extravagant and opulent space, designed to showcase Thallium's wealth and power. Much of the rooftop is devoted to an outdoor lounge area, with comfortable seating and a fire pit, centered around a hot tub and flanked by a bar. All around is the city of New Reykjavik, and beyond that the red Martian landscape. Around the entirety of the roof is an electrostatic field designed to keep air in and particulates out. To the north is a large cage, and to the west is a landing pad. Jones can distantly see a woman lying on the floor of the cage.

Admiral Thallium's flyer is hovering above you.

>n
Thallium's flyer floats after Jones.

Galaxy Jones is next to the cage. The closely-set silnium bars seem to dash all hope of a rescue. The flyer pad is to the southwest and the rest of the rooftop to the south.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Admiral Thallium's flyer is hovering above you.

Thallium: "Here I go, Jones! Here I go! I'm really leaving this time! Jones! Are you listening? I'm going!"

>talk to europa
She's too out of it to respond.

>climb cage
Jones gets onto the cage.

>attach cable to cage

Jones throws the cable up to the flyer where it hooks around the rail, and attaches the other end to the cage, then jumps off the cage to escape the aftermath. Seeing his flyer's predicament, Thallium jumps out of the craft and disappears below the edge of the roof. The flyer reaches the end of its tether and slingshots downwards, slamming into side of the building.

The cage has tilted to the side, one attachment torn loose from the rooftop. Jones crawls into the cage to see to Europa Callisto.

"Europa! Can you hear me? I need you to move to get out of this cage. I can't carry you through that small opening. Europa!"

Europa moans but doesn't show any signs of having understood Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the cage. The whole structure is tilted, leaving a hole at the eastern end. The flyer pad is to the southwest and the rest of the rooftop to the south.

Jones is kneeling at Europa Callisto's side, trying to rouse her.

The red flyer, now recognizable as Galaxy's own, settles down onto the landing pad.

>pour water on europa
It's not elegant, but it works.

Jones opens the water bottle and brings it to Europa's lips. Even with closed eyes she drinks, first slowly and then with increasing vigor, until her eyes open.

"Ga- Galaxy Jones?" she says.

Jones nods, but says "We'll have time for introductions later. We have to get out of here before the roof is full of killer robots. Can you crawl? If you can get through that hole I can carry you the rest of the way."

Europa nods. "I think so."

Galaxy Jones helps her through the hole in the cage, then gently picks her up and jogs toward the waiting flyer. Beck's familiar face appears at the door of the aircraft, urging her on.

Not so far away, Admiral Thallium crawls back over the edge of the roof. As he pulls himself up, he aims a pistol at Jones's back...

The shot hits her full in the back and she falls sprawling on the landing pad, Europa Callisto tumbling from her arms. Beck is by Callisto's side in a moment, lifting her and carrying her into the flyer.

And then the robots swarm the roof like a mechanical rainbow tide. By the time Beck returns to the door it is already too late. A group of robots surrounds Jones, while another robot carries Thallium triumphantly. Beck has no choice but to take off, leaving Jones behind, not knowing if she still lives...

<Black screen>

"Jones! Jones! Wake up! I'm trying to talk to you!"

<Cut to a shot of two closed eyes>

"C'mon, open those eyes."

<The shot widens to show Galaxy Jones, the Solar System's greatest hero, flat on the floor, seemingly unconscious>

"This is getting tiresome, Jones. Stop playing dead."

Her eyes flutter open, close again, then open. She winces and brings one hand up to shield her eyes. "Who's that?" she says, hoarsely.
