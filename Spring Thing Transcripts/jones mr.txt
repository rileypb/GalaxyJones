>ask beck about game

Beck: "Well, you can ask about: INTERACTIVE FICTION, COMMANDS, or CREDITS."

>ask beck about if
Beck: "I'm not sure what you're asking about, Jones."

>* ah well
I didn't understand that sentence.

>ask beck about interactive fiction

Beck: "According to Wikipedia, 'Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment.' In more plain language, in this game you'll explore places, acquire objects, and defeat enemies all by typing commands. For instance, if you found an axe, you would type TAKE AXE to take it, and DROP AXE to drop it again."

You can move around in the world by typing commands like GO NORTH, which can be abbreviated as N. If you need to refresh your memory about your surroundings you can say LOOK, or just L. To see what you're holding, use INVENTORY, or I. You can find out more about that axe from before by typing EXAMINE AXE, or just X AXE."

Of course, any game has limitations, so you can't just enter any old sentence and expect to have it understood. ASK BECK ABOUT COMMANDS for a partial list of commands that will work."

>ask beck about commands

"Here's a partial list of commands with explanations and/or examples:"
 
 * TAKE: TAKE GOLD COIN
 * DROP: DROP GOLD COIN
 * I: list the player's possessions
 * X: examine something; X GOLD COIN
 * L: look around
 * CLIMB: CLIMB BEANSTALK
 * GET OFF: GET OFF BEANSTALK
 * PUT INTO: PUT GOLD COIN INTO TREASURE CHEST
 * PUSH: PUSH BIG RED BUTTON
 
 not to mention POUR, TYPE, OPEN, CLOSE, UNLOCK, SHOOT, and a few others you'll have to figure out for yourself.

>x me


>i
Jones is carrying:
  a black jumpsuit (being worn)
  a disruptor pistol

>x jumpsuit
It's an advanced Smart Suit, able to communicate sound, vision, and radar back to Beck at Galaxy Base. Also it has a neat light.

>x pistol
A compact instrument of death, with only one setting: kill.

>x light
It automatically goes on when it gets dark. Cool.

>* cool indeed!

Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

>x one
Galaxy One is a Dust Runner, a top-of-the-line model from Olympus Speedworks. It's deep crimson with tinted windows. Powerful turbines adorn vestigial wings that sweep back in severe rearward arcs.

>x windows
(outside)
Outside the building are the red-dusted streets of New Reykjavik.

>x viking
The entryway is dominated by the towering façade of a Viking king, namesake of the building itself.

>* ...isn't it just called the Viking Building?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x turbines
The engines cause Jones to recoil from the waves of heat rolling off of them.

>x wings
Not technically necessary as the speeder works via anti-gravity, the blade-like wings nonetheless give the vehicle a certain flair unobtainable by other means.

>n
Jones approaches the Viking Building entryway, the dramatic façade towering over her.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones looks up at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

>* oh interesting not to have the traditional room name display -- I kinda like it!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x oor
There's nothing like that nearby.

>oops door
A glass revolving door emblazoned with the symbol of a Viking king astride the planet Mars.

>x king
There's nothing like that nearby.

>x viking
The entryway is dominated by the towering façade of a Viking king, namesake of the building itself.

>x mars
There's nothing like that nearby.

>enter door
That's not something Jones can enter.

>* just checking!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>n
Jones takes a deep breath. "I'm going in."

Beck replies, "You got this, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above the center of the area, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

>x sculpture
Suddenly two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! Jones dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

>* eek!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x robots
Definitely not a friendly android. More of a spiny killer with a disruptor barrel mounted on its head.

>hide
I didn't understand that sentence.

>take cover
There's nothing like that nearby.

>x desk
There's not much on the desk other than a sticky note that says "39154".

The two robots coordinate fire over the desk, narrowly missing Jones.

>* handy!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>shoot robots
Jones's shot hits a robot dead on, but nothing happens, almost as if the robot had absorbed the energy.

Jones: "Target seems to be absorbing disruptor fire. This will make things a little harder."

Beck: "Got it."

One of the robots fires directly above her head.

>shoot crystal
Jones fires the disruptor into the sculpture's main support cable, snapping it. The huge crystal blob starts to sag, straining the other cables. In quick succession they break as well, and the whole installation plummets to the ground, right on top of the hapless guard robots.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

>x sculpture
Jones digs through the ruins and finds a cable with hooks at either end, which she takes.

>* always handy!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x robots
Jones searches some more, but nothing further turns up.

>x expanse
There's nothing like that nearby.

>x plants
The ground floor is huge and made for holding people comfortably. Thus the hundreds of seats amidst Earth pleasures such as water and living green plants.

>x water
The ground floor is huge and made for holding people comfortably. Thus the hundreds of seats amidst Earth pleasures such as water and living green plants.

Jones crosses the floor carefully, disruptor pistol at the ready.

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the ground floor. The centerpiece of this area is the actual Viking 2 lander, which landed right here on Utopia Planitia. The glass walls look out onto the city. She can go north or west from here.

Admiral Thallium's voice booms from the ceiling. "Little Galaxy thinks she's beaten the big bad Admiral. Sorry dear, that was only a taste."

>* Wait, is the building actually named after the spacecraft?  I am getting more and more confused
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x lnder
There's nothing like that nearby.

>oops lander
The lander is such a big, ungainly object it's hard to imagine it was once a pinnacle of human achievement.

>enter it
It's wasn't a manned craft.

>* "it's" -> "It"
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x walls
Outside the building are the red-dusted streets of New Reykjavik.

>push lander
Really, Jones doesn't even feel good about touching such an important relic.

>n

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

Beck: "Blueprints indicate a closet to the west of you. Might be useful."

>x canapes
The table is covered with a wide array of treats from the ridiculously expensive, such as shrimp tea sandwiches (where do you get shrimp on Mars?), to the just plain ridiculous, like poached ostrich eggs in jelly. A good number of forks are laid out to one side.

Jones: "What would you like me to bring you, Beck? Shrimp tea sandwiches, or poached ostrich eggs?"

Beck: "Oh, the shrimp. Definitely get the shrimp."

>x forks
A very stylish silver-plated fork.

>take fork
Taken.

>x egg
Definitely not to Jones's taste.

Jones: "You ever have poached ostrich eggs, Beck?"

Beck: "No, but I'll take you for some when you're done there."

Jones: "Oh, thanks."

>eat egg
Sorry, no.

>x shrimp
Simply delightful.

>eat it
Jones is not hungry.

>take egg
Don't even.

>take shrimp
Taken.

>i
Jones is carrying:
  a shrimp tea sandwich
  a fork
  a sticky note
  a cable with hooks at either end
  a black jumpsuit (being worn)
  a disruptor pistol

>w
(first opening the closet door)
Jones will have to enter the correct code on the keypad first.

>x note
The note says "39154".

>enter 39154
(on the keypad)
An indicator light by the door to the west glows green.

Jones: "I've unlocked the east side utility door."

>w
(first opening the closet door)

Galaxy Jones is in the maintenance closet. A bare, white-walled room containing various maintenance items. The exit is to the east.

There is an Atmo-Suit hanging from a hook here.

On the shelf is a red cardkey.

>* boom
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x items
Various uninteresting items, like mops and brooms and the like.

>x suit
(the black jumpsuit)
It's an advanced Smart Suit, able to communicate sound, vision, and radar back to Beck at Galaxy Base. Also it has a neat light.

>x atmo
The Atmo-Suit is a pressure suit ideal for outside work in thin atmospheres like that of Mars.

>take it
Taken.

>wear it
Jones needs to be able to move around quickly. Better not wear the Atmo-Suit.

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases. All this despite the fact that no one has turned up any evidence that Thallium served in any navy of any country on any planet. One can escape to the west or south.

Jones: "Now this is some choice bullshit here."

Beck: "Looks like the record of the good Admiral's long and dedicated service."

>x uniforms
Jones yawns looking over the assortment of faux honors. They're all behind glass, but one of the display cases is partly open, leaving the rather garish medal inside unprotected.

>x medal
While the front looks authentic, the reverse is engraved with Thallium's personal motto "Planetas Vincam". The ribbon conceals a safety pin. It looks like it could be removed.

>take it
Taken.

>x pin
A standard silver metal safety pin.

>w

Galaxy Jones is on the north side of the ground floor. The area is dominated by a towering statue of Admiral Thallium against the north wall. The ground floor extends west and east from here. The elevator is to the south.

>x statue
His nauseating visage seems to leer at Jones, and she suppresses a shiver of disgust.

Jones groans. "Be glad you're not here, Beck. This is revolting."

Beck chuckles. "I won't ask."

>push it
It won't budge.

>shoot it
Jones only uses violent means when absolutely necessary.

>climb it
Little is to be achieved by that.

>w

Galaxy Jones is at the northwest corner of the ground floor. A large relief map of Mars is mounted on the north wall here. One can leave here to the south or east.

>x map
The map is crafted of bronze and sports a star at the site of New Reykjavik.

>x star
Ah, New Reykjavik! Even colder than Old Reykjavik!

>take it
That seems to be a part of the large relief map of Mars.

>s

Galaxy Jones is on the west side of the ground floor. Semicircular couches open on either side of a central carpeted path leading north and south. Set in the central pillar of the building to the east is a utility door. The city looms beyond the glass wall to the west.

>x couches
An inoffensive beige couch, shaped in a half-circle.

>e
(first opening the utility door)
It seems to be locked.

(first opening the utility door)

Galaxy Jones is in the elevator room. This is a utility room related to the operation of the elevator, on the other side of the east wall here. There is a control panel on the wall, and a door leading west.

Hanging from a hook here is a drop key.

Lying discarded on a table here is a hammer.

>x panel
From the looks of it, elevator technology hasn't evolved much since it was first developed. This control panel is a primitive collection of wires, circuit boards, indicator lights, and other components. It also seems to be completely inactive -- none of the lights are on.

>x drop
A drop key is a special device used to open an elevator door from the outside. It consists of a thin shaft which is hinged at th-- oh just Google it.

>* Oh hey I remember seeing you ask about this on the forums!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>take drop
Taken.

>x hammer
An ordinary claw hammer.

Galaxy Jones is at the southwest corner of the ground floor. A lush indoor waterfall here contrasts with the dusty red streets of New Reykjavik beyond the glass walls. The ground floor extends north and east.

>x waterfall
The waterfall descends the length of an artificial rock formation fringed by wide-leaved Earth plants and ferns. The water collects in a basin at the bottom, where it begins its journey again. A single coin sits on the bottom of the basin.

Jones: "One coin? Not very generous people around here."

>x coin
A one-Areo coin, with Ares on the front and the Viking 2 lander on the back.

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator hall. This hallway between the north and south ends of the ground floor is home to the elevator to the west. To the east is the entrance to a stairwell.

>e
As soon as Jones enters the stairwell, a disruptor blast from above zings past her shoulder, and she beats a hasty retreat. She won't be going up the stairs until she can clear out the resistance, and she can't do that from here.

Jones: "I've got gunfire from somewhere up the stairs. I'll have to get above them and take them out from behind."

Beck: "Sounds like a plan."

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator hall. This hallway between the north and south ends of the ground floor is home to the elevator to the west. To the east is the entrance to a stairwell.

>x elevator
(the elevator door)
A gleaming gold elevator door. There is a hole near the top for inserting a drop key.

>w
(first opening the elevator door)
Jones can't just open the elevator with her hands.

>put key in hole
(the drop key in the small hole)
Jones inserts the drop key into the small hole and turns it, disengaging the lock mechanism. Then she slides the door open, exposing an empty elevator shaft to the west.

>w
Jones climbs into the elevator shaft.

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator shaft. She is at the bottom of a dark well. Shining her suit light up, she can see that the elevator car is several floors up, unmoving. There is a ladder running up the wall next to the door.

Beck: "Ooh. It's like we're in an action film."

>u
Jones climbs up the shaft, stopping at each floor to test each door. She gets all the way to the ninth floor, directly below the elevator car, before finding one that opens.

Galaxy Jones is in the ninth floor elevator shaft. The door to the east is open.

Beck: "Huh. Seems like it should have taken longer than that."

>u
The way further up is blocked by the elevator car.

>* stop breaking the fourth wall, Beck
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Jones: "Finally out of the shaft. That was quite a climb."

Beck: "This floor is just offices. Check the building management office to the west. It might have some useful stuff."

Jones exits the shaft, the door sliding closed behind her.

Galaxy Jones is in the ninth floor elevator hall. The elevator is to the west, the stairwell is to the east, and a corridor leads north and south. There is a bottled water vending machine here.

Galaxy Jones is at the south end of the building management office. The building management office is a bunch of desks and task boards. There is a filing cabinet against the east wall. The office exit is to the east, and the office continues to the north.

A screwdriver sits atop the filing cabinet.

>x screwdriver
A standard Phillips screwdriver with a red plastic handle.

>take it
Jones reaches for the screwdriver, but she fumbles it and it rolls off the back of the filing cabinet.

Jones: "Damn."

Beck: "What? What's going on?"

Jones: "Just being clumsy is all."

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities.

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I can get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

>sneak
(toward the purple guard robot)
Jones creeps a little ways toward the guard robot.

>g
(toward the purple guard robot)
Slowly, slowly, Jones gets a little closer. Just a little more...

She must have poked up her shoulder or something, for the guard robot fires his disruptor. The shot takes out a window on the east side of the room. The electrostatic field around the building keeps the atmosphere from pouring out.

>g
(toward the purple guard robot)
Jones is right up next to the robot, crouched beneath a desk. She can see right up under its armor.

>x armor

Definitely not a friendly android. More of a spiny killer with a disruptor barrel mounted on its head.

The guard robot moves a little farther away from Jones.

>shoot window
Which do you mean, broken window or outside?

Jones only uses violent means when absolutely necessary.

Jones aims the pistol upward under the robot's enhanced armor and fires. She flinches back when the robot's innards explode downward in a shower of sparks. It topples over, dead. Jones stands up and surveys her handiwork.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x down
Okay, fine. Jones looks down, slowly, slowly... and there's a window cleaner's scaffold, about six feet below her.

Jones: "Okay, so. There's a window washing platform right below me. I might be able to drop down to it, but I won't be able to get back up."

Beck: "Take it easy, Jones."

>x scaffold
It certainly looks more inviting than this ledge.

>d
Jones drops off the ledge onto the scaffold. It rocks unnervingly for a moment.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the eighth floor window. There doesn't seem to be any way to get into the building here. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

>push up

Jones presses the button, and the scaffold begins to rise.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the ninth floor window. She could climb back into the building through the window here. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Jones: "I hate it out here."

Jones presses the button, and the scaffold begins to rise.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the tenth floor. Instead of a window, there's what appears to be an exhaust vent. If it's for forced air, though, the fan is currently not running. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Jones: "Alright, I'm by the tenth floor now. What's this grille thing here?"

Beck: "That's an exhaust vent. There's an air handling room on this floor which it leads into. If you can remove the cover you should be able to access the whole floor from here."

>g

The scaffold is as far up as it will go.

>open cover
Jones loosens the screws with the screwdriver and opens the grille.

>enter grille
Jones climbs inside the vent, crawls along a short length of ductwork, and emerges through another hinged grille, into the air handling room.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

Galaxy Jones is in the air handling room. There is a good number of loud fans and other air handling machinery here. A small hinged vent opening leads into some ductwork, and from there to the outside. A door leads west.

She takes off the Atmo-Suit.

Jones: "Ha! I'm in!"

Beck: "Be careful, you're likely to run into more resistance here. The floor is all one open office, so any guard robots will have good line of sight."

Jones: "Got it."

Beck: "And Jones? Save your game."

As soon as Jones enters the stairwell, a disruptor blast from above zings past her shoulder, and she beats a hasty retreat. She won't be going up the stairs until she can clear out the resistance, and she can't do that from here.

Galaxy Jones is in the elevator car. It's luxurious, with gold-plated walls and crystal lighting on the ceiling. The button panel is lacquered dark mahogany with what look like real ivory buttons. The carpeting is soft and plush. A golden keyhole sits above the buttons. You can leave the elevator to the east.

One of the ceiling panels looks loose.

Admiral Thallium's voice oozes from concealed speakers: "Yes, Jones, that is real ivory. I imported the elephant here myself for a hunt on my estate. You have no idea how much money it takes to simulate an African jungle on Mars. In retrospect I should have gotten an Indian elephant."

Galaxy Jones is in the tenth floor elevator hall. The elevator car to the west stands open. There is a stairwell to the east. The hall runs north and south into a sumptuous corporate office.

>w

Galaxy Jones is in the elevator car. It's luxurious, with gold-plated walls and crystal lighting on the ceiling. The button panel is lacquered dark mahogany with what look like real ivory buttons. The carpeting is soft and plush. A golden keyhole sits above the buttons. There is a hole in the ceiling big enough for Jones to squeeze through. You can leave the elevator to the east.

The remains of the mauve guard robot are sprawled on the ground.

>unlock keyhole
That doesn't seem to be something Jones can unlock.

>put golden in keyhole
(the golden key in the golden keyhole)
Jones puts the key in the keyhole and turns. There is a pleasant chime, and some buttons light up.

The elevator accelerates upwards at a frightening rate. The numbers climb towards 100. Soon the elevator slows, and the door opens on the 100th floor.

Jones: "Holy - This thing goes fast."

Galaxy Jones is in the southern corner of the penthouse. This must be Thallium's "treasure room", to go by the obscene display of wealth. The most notable feature is the array of diamonds lining the walls. Everything else here pales in comparison. The penthouse continues to the northwest, north, and northeast.

Thallium seems to speak from all around Jones. "You like diamonds, Jones? Of course you do -- they're a girl's best friend, after all."

Jones snorts, "Sure, Thallium."

>x diamonds
So many of them, from the tiny to the obscenely large. It looks like it wouldn't be hard to pry one out.

>take diamon
There's nothing like that nearby.

>take diamond
You pry one of the diamonds out of the wall.

Thallium giggles. "Oh, I hope you're not disappointed, Jones."

>x it

Jones: "Hmm. This is made of glass."

Thallium: "Poor, sad Jones. But here's the thing. There is a real diamond in there; it's just you'll never find it before the building's defenses flood the whole floor with poisonous gas. Or maybe I'm bluffing. Maybe I'm not. Can you afford to gamble?"

Jones tosses the fake away.

>search diamonds
Jones finds nothing of interest.

It's impossible to tell which ones are real and which are glass without prying each one out separately.

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. Thallium's personal insignia, the ten planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam", is carved into the deep red wood outer wall, and inlaid with ebony. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something. Finally, there is something that looks like an electronic eye set into the inner wall. One may leave to the northeast or southeast.

As soon as insert the diamond into the claw, laser beams spring from five emitters on the walls. They hit the diamond and join into a single more powerful beam that strikes the electronic eye on the wall.

Jones walks out onto the luxurious penthouse roof. Admiral Thallium turns from the railing to face her. He is dressed in an absurd elaboration of a Martian Admiral's uniform. He looks Jones up and down with a lecherous leer. "Ah, Galaxy Jones, as lovely as ever. If it weren't so unbearably cliché I'd ask you to join me in my rise to greatness. But alas, you are too habituated to the smug high of 'goodness'." He sighs dramatically. "We've trodden similar ground before; no need to discuss it further. Although I would challenge any of your various amoureux to conjugate 'tread' correctly.

"Anyway, I guess this is the time where you do something predictably undignified and violent. Before you do I feel I should inform you that your sidearm has been rendered quite ineffective by my personal security field. But do go ahead and try it."

Jones sneers. "I wouldn't give you the satisfaction," she says, looking around. "I see you don't have any of your robot pets up here. How are you going to stop me from rescuing Europa?"

"Oh please, while we're trying things, try that too. I wish you luck breaking the silnium bars of the cage."

"What's silnium?"

"A superstrong material invented here in my Martian Chemical laboratory. We had a press conference for it -- weren't you watching?"

"Couldn't be bothered."

"Oh for frotz sake, Jones, you're so frustrating!"

Thallium turns his back on Jones and stares out over the city.

Galaxy Jones is on the penthouse roof. It is an extravagant and opulent space, designed to showcase Thallium's wealth and power. Much of the rooftop is devoted to an outdoor lounge area, with comfortable seating and a fire pit, centered around a hot tub and flanked by a bar. All around is the city of New Reykjavik, and beyond that the red Martian landscape. Around the entirety of the roof is an electrostatic field designed to keep air in and particulates out. To the north is a large cage, and to the west is a landing pad. Jones can distantly see a woman lying on the floor of the cage. A green and black flyer sits on the landing pad.

Admiral Thallium is sulking.

Thallium smirks. "Personal security field, remember? Now I must be off."

Jones watches as Thallium boards the flyer. It takes off a moment later.

Galaxy Jones is on the flyer pad. This is what one would expect from a rooftop flyer pad: landing lights surrounding a large letter F painted in white on a red background. Europa's cage is to the northeast and the rest of the rooftop is to the east.

>undo
Galaxy Jones is on the penthouse roof.
[Previous turn undone.]

>* missing opening quotation mark at the beginning there

>n

Galaxy Jones is next to the cage. The closely-set silnium bars seem to dash all hope of a rescue. The flyer pad is to the southwest and the rest of the rooftop to the south.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Jones tries the strength of the bars just in case. They don't budge.

South of the cage, Thallium crosses the roof to the flyer pad, where he boards the waiting flyer. The flyer lifts off and moves towards Jones.

>x bars
The cage is huge for holding just one prisoner. The silnium bars are grey and iridescent. They run both horizontally and vertically, creating a lattice. The floor is hard and cold.

Thallium's flyer hovers over the rooftop. "Jones!"  he bellows. "Play time is over. I grow weary of your intransigence. In a moment this roof will be swarmed by guard robots -- of many different colors -- so many robots you couldn't possibly vandalize them all.  Say your prayers, Jones, or whatever you do when you're about to die."

Jones rolls her eyes.

A little ways off, another flyer, small and red, aims for the rooftop and accelerates.

>x red
(the red cardkey)
An anonymous red card with a magnetic stripe.

>x red flyer
It's little more than a growing red speck.

>x green
There's nothing like that nearby.

>x flyer
Which do you mean, the red flyer or Admiral Thallium's flyer?

>admiral
Hovering above Jones, it's distinctly menacing. It's not visibly armed, but it conveys the impression of a beast about to strike. It's flying low, the rails of its landing gear just a few feet above Jones's head.

>hook cable to landing gear
Jones would achieve nothing by this.

Thallium's flyer is circling you not too far away. "Give up, Jones! You'll never get through my silnium bars, haha!"

>* sure seems like hooking the cable to the cage and the landing gear would achieve a lot!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>hook cable to cage
It doesn't seem useful to attach the cable to this part of the cage.

>x cage

Jones throws the cable up to the flyer where it hooks around the rail, and attaches the other end to the cage, then jumps off the cage to escape the aftermath. Seeing his flyer's predicament, Thallium jumps out of the craft and disappears below the edge of the roof. The flyer reaches the end of its tether and slingshots downwards, slamming into side of the building.

The cage has tilted to the side, one attachment torn loose from the rooftop. Jones crawls into the cage to see to Europa Callisto.

"Europa! Can you hear me? I need you to move to get out of this cage. I can't carry you through that small opening. Europa!"

Europa moans but doesn't show any signs of having understood Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the cage. The whole structure is tilted, leaving a hole at the eastern end. The flyer pad is to the southwest and the rest of the rooftop to the south.

Jones is kneeling at Europa Callisto's side, trying to rouse her.

The red flyer, now recognizable as Galaxy's own, settles down onto the landing pad.

>* OK, had the right idea -- that felt a little fiddly (I didn't realize it was out of reach from the first couple responses)
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>take europa
Jones could carry Europa to the hole in the cage, but she'd never get her through without help.

>i
Jones is carrying:
  a black cardkey
  a screwdriver
  a full water bottle
  a hammer
  a drop key
  a safety pin
  a garish medal
  a red cardkey
  an Atmo-Suit
  a fork
  a sticky note
  a black jumpsuit (being worn)
  a disruptor pistol

Beck sticks his head out of the door of the flyer and yells "C'mon Jones, get Europa and get in the flyer!"

>get europa
Jones could carry Europa to the hole in the cage, but she'd never get her through without help.

>give water to europa
Jones opens the water bottle and brings it to Europa's lips. Even with closed eyes she drinks, first slowly and then with increasing vigor, until her eyes open.

"Ga- Galaxy Jones?" she says.

Jones nods, but says "We'll have time for introductions later. We have to get out of here before the roof is full of killer robots. Can you crawl? If you can get through that hole I can carry you the rest of the way."

Europa nods. "I think so."

Galaxy Jones helps her through the hole in the cage, then gently picks her up and jogs toward the waiting flyer. Beck's familiar face appears at the door of the aircraft, urging her on.

Not so far away, Admiral Thallium crawls back over the edge of the roof. As he pulls himself up, he aims a pistol at Jones's back...

The shot hits her full in the back and she falls sprawling on the landing pad, Europa Callisto tumbling from her arms. Beck is by Callisto's side in a moment, lifting her and carrying her into the flyer.

And then the robots swarm the roof like a mechanical rainbow tide. By the time Beck returns to the door it is already too late. A group of robots surrounds Jones, while another robot carries Thallium triumphantly. Beck has no choice but to take off, leaving Jones behind, not knowing if she still lives...

<Black screen>

"Jones! Jones! Wake up! I'm trying to talk to you!"

<Cut to a shot of two closed eyes>

"C'mon, open those eyes."

<The shot widens to show Galaxy Jones, the Solar System's greatest hero, flat on the floor, seemingly unconscious>

"This is getting tiresome, Jones. Stop playing dead."

Her eyes flutter open, close again, then open. She winces and brings one hand up to shield her eyes. "Who's that?" she says, hoarsely.
