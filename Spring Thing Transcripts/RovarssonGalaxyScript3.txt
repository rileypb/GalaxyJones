As soon as Jones enters the stairwell, a disruptor blast from above zings past her shoulder, and she beats a hasty retreat. She won't be going up the stairs until she can clear out the resistance, and she can't do that from here.

Jones climbs into the elevator shaft.

Galaxy Jones is in the ground floor elevator shaft. She is at the bottom of a dark well. Shining her suit light up, she can see that the elevator car is several floors up, unmoving. There is a ladder running up the wall next to the door.

Beck: "Ooh. It's like we're in an action film."

>x ladder
A simple steel ladder.

>climb ladder
Jones climbs up the shaft, stopping at each floor to test each door. She gets all the way to the ninth floor, directly below the elevator car, before finding one that opens.

Galaxy Jones is in the ninth floor elevator shaft. The door to the east is open.

Beck: "Huh. Seems like it should have taken longer than that."

Galaxy Jones is at the south end of the building management office. The building management office is a bunch of desks and task boards. There is a filing cabinet against the east wall. The office exit is to the east, and the office continues to the north.

A screwdriver sits atop the filing cabinet.

>x desks

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

>x sculpture
Jones searches some more, but nothing further turns up.

>x robots
Jones searches some more, but nothing further turns up.

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases. All this despite the fact that no one has turned up any evidence that Thallium served in any navy of any country on any planet. One can escape to the west or south.

>x medal
While the front looks authentic, the reverse is engraved with Thallium's personal motto "Planetas Vincam". Earlier Jones removed the safety pin.

>e

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities.

As soon as Jones steps into the office, a shot zaps just past her nose. She dives to the ground, protected by the maze of desks and chairs. Peeking through the mesh back of one of the chairs, she takes notice of both the purple guard robot training its disruptor on the room, and the chair's fine construction and lumbar support.

Jones (whispering): "We've got another one! I'm out of sight for now, but it's going to be hard to get a shot off at this 'bot."

Beck: "What's the situation?"

Jones: "I'm on the floor with desks and chairs all around. The target is a few yards off, coming this way. I can get a shot in, but it might just absorb it anyway."

Beck: "Well, see if you can sneak up on it. Maybe close up you can find a way past its defenses."

Galaxy Jones is in the Cybernetica office. It's spacious and luxurious, designed to make developers forget how spent they are from months of overwork and abuse. Ergonomic desks and chairs fill space like a furniture fractal, before giving way to an open area, presumably for group activities.

Ok.

>shoot robot
Jones raises her head and fires wide. The robot fires back. Jones ducks and crawls off among the labyrinth of desks.

Beck: "Are you still shooting at those things? Even if you hit 'em it's not going to leave a scratch."

Jones (whispering): "So what do you propose?"

Beck: "Get closer. Keep your head down, but move in closer to it until you can get a good shot in."

Jones creeps a little ways toward the guard robot.

>g
Slowly, slowly, Jones gets a little closer. Just a little more...

She must have poked up her shoulder or something, for the guard robot fires his disruptor. The shot takes out a window on the east side of the room. The electrostatic field around the building keeps the atmosphere from pouring out.

(outside)
Looking down at New Reykjavik, one can trace the history of the city, as it expanded radially from its original domes, the multiple frontiers colliding and interfering like ripples in a pond, until eventually, the map gave way to rectangular regularity. The Viking Building stands near the periphery, overlooking the vast red plain of Utopia Planitia.

Jones: "I'm going out the window to see if I can find a way to get up to the tenth floor."

Beck: "Whoa whoa whoa, Jones. You know you're not good with heights."

Jones: "Ask Thallium how how much that matters once I've kicked his ass. Watch me, I'll look down and not even flinch."

Jones puts on the Atmo-Suit.

Galaxy Jones is on a ledge. The ledge runs north and south. Jones is plastered up against the wall, trying not to look down.

>look down
Are you sure? Jones is really afraid of heights.

>look down
Okay, fine. Jones looks down, slowly, slowly... and there's a window cleaner's scaffold, about six feet below her.

Galaxy Jones is on a window washing scaffold. It's lined up with the tenth floor. Instead of a window, there's what appears to be an exhaust vent. If it's for forced air, though, the fan is currently not running. Mounted on the scaffold is a control panel with two buttons: one indicating up and one indicating down.

Jones: "Alright, I'm by the tenth floor now. What's this grille thing here?"

Beck: "That's an exhaust vent. There's an air handling room on this floor which it leads into. If you can remove the cover you should be able to access the whole floor from here."

>push up

Jones climbs inside the vent, crawls along a short length of ductwork, and emerges through another hinged grille, into the air handling room.
