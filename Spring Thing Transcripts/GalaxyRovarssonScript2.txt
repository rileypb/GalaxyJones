Galaxy Jones is at the southwest corner of the ground floor. A lush indoor waterfall here contrasts with the dusty red streets of New Reykjavik beyond the glass walls. The ground floor extends north and east.

>* && The robot hurdle taken, Galaxy investigates further...
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x waterfall
The waterfall descends the length of an artificial rock formation fringed by wide-leaved Earth plants and ferns. The water collects in a basin at the bottom, where it begins its journey again. A single coin sits on the bottom of the basin.

Jones: "One coin? Not very generous people around here."

There's nothing like that nearby.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. Jones may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building. There are two niches in the central wall from which the guard robots emerged.

Spread across the floor in a tangled ruin are the remains of a giant crystal sculpture and two guard robots.

I didn't understand that sentence.

Aside from a robot charging station, there's nothing here.

Jones crosses the floor carefully, disruptor pistol at the ready.

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the ground floor. The centerpiece of this area is the actual Viking 2 lander, which landed right here on Utopia Planitia. The glass walls look out onto the city. She can go north or west from here.

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the ground floor. Apparently some kind of function was happening here before Admiral Thallium emptied the building, for there is an array of canapes on a catering table here. The floor stretches north and south, and there's a closet door to the west.

Beck: "Blueprints indicate a closet to the west of you. Might be useful."

>x canapes
The table is covered with a wide array of treats from the ridiculously expensive, such as shrimp tea sandwiches (where do you get shrimp on Mars?), to the just plain ridiculous, like poached ostrich eggs in jelly. A good number of forks are laid out to one side.

Jones: "What would you like me to bring you, Beck? Shrimp tea sandwiches, or poached ostrich eggs?"

Beck: "Oh, the shrimp. Definitely get the shrimp."

>get eggs
Don't even.

Sorry, no.

Simply delightful.

Galaxy Jones is in the maintenance closet. A bare, white-walled room containing various maintenance items. The exit is to the east.

There is an Atmo-Suit hanging from a hook here.

On the shelf is a red cardkey.

>e
Jones almost bumps into a glass wall.

>n

Galaxy Jones is at the northeast corner of the ground floor. The area is dedicated to celebrating the military career of Admiral Thallium. Uniforms, medals, ribbons, and other miscellanea are mounted on the wall or in showcases. All this despite the fact that no one has turned up any evidence that Thallium served in any navy of any country on any planet. One can escape to the west or south.

Jones: "Now this is some choice bullshit here."

Beck: "Looks like the record of the good Admiral's long and dedicated service."

>x uniforms
Jones yawns looking over the assortment of faux honors. They're all behind glass, but one of the display cases is partly open, leaving the rather garish medal inside unprotected.

>x medal
While the front looks authentic, the reverse is engraved with Thallium's personal motto "Planetas Vincam". The ribbon conceals a safety pin. It looks like it could be removed.
