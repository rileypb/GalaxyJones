(first opening the air handling door)

Galaxy Jones is on the north side of the Consolidated Microthings office. This is the company cafeteria. The elevator is south, the air handling room is to the east, and the office continues to the west and southeast.

Thallium's voice booms over the office PA: "You can run, Jones, but you can't - well, there aren't very many places you can hide."

>s

Galaxy Jones is in the tenth floor elevator hall. The elevator car to the west stands open. There is a stairwell to the east. The hall runs north and south into a sumptuous corporate office.

>w

Galaxy Jones is in the elevator car. It's luxurious, with gold-plated walls and crystal lighting on the ceiling. The button panel is lacquered dark mahogany with what look like real ivory buttons. The carpeting is soft and plush. A golden keyhole sits above the buttons. You can leave the elevator to the east.

One of the ceiling panels looks loose.

Admiral Thallium's voice oozes from concealed speakers: "Yes, Jones, that is real ivory. I imported the elephant here myself for a hunt on my estate. You have no idea how much money it takes to simulate an African jungle on Mars. In retrospect I should have gotten an Indian elephant."


>pull panel

Jones removes the ceiling panel, exposing a hole wide enough for her to squeeze through.

The exit is to the east.

Galaxy Jones is on the south side of the Consolidated Microthings office. This is reception. The front desk has a great view of the New Reykjavik Botanic Dome. Couches are lined up to take advantage. The floor extends east and west, and north to the elevator.

Jones sees the mauve guard robot nearby to the west. 

>e

Galaxy Jones is at the southeast corner of the Consolidated Microthings office. This corner of the floor contains the gym and other company amenities. Reception is to the west, and an empty area lies to the north.

A couple of steps to the west, the mauve guard robot heads east.

>n

Galaxy Jones is on the east side of the Consolidated Microthings office. This part of the office is currently unused. Jones can go northwest or south from here.

The mauve guard robot appears nearby to the south, coming from the west.

Beck: "That's one ugly dude."

Jones: "I wouldn't want to meet it up close."

Galaxy Jones is on the top of the elevator car. The elevator shaft extends many hundreds of feet above her. She can see down into the elevator car from here.

The mauve guard robot enters the elevator car below.

>jump robot
Jones drops down through the ceiling and on to the guard robot. It swings around looking for her, obviously panicked that it can't bring its gun to bear on its attacker. Jones manages to hang on.

The mauve guard robot struggles against her hold on it, to no avail.

>pour gel on robot
Jones pours the gel into the vent on the robot's head. The robot flails around wildly and throws her from its back, then lets out a loud crackling sound and stops moving.

Galaxy Jones is at the southwest corner of the Consolidated Microthings office. This looks like the IT area of the office. Numerous desks and an abundance of computer parts are here. Jones can go north or east from here.

There is a present with a note attached sitting on a desk here.

Galaxy Jones is in the 100th floor elevator hall. The luxury is staggering.  The walls are made of polished black marble, and the floors are covered in plush black carpeting that muffles the sound of footsteps. The ceiling is high and adorned with a crystal chandelier. The elevator doors to the west are gold-plated. Sumptuous living quarters are visible to the north and south.

Dark black, almost threatening, rounding out the storm cloud atmosphere of the room.

Galaxy Jones is in the southern corner of the penthouse. This must be Thallium's "treasure room", to go by the obscene display of wealth. The most notable feature is the array of diamonds lining the walls. Everything else here pales in comparison. The penthouse continues to the northwest, north, and northeast.

Thallium seems to speak from all around Jones. "You like diamonds, Jones? Of course you do -- they're a girl's best friend, after all."

Jones snorts, "Sure, Thallium."

>x diamonds
So many of them, from the tiny to the obscenely large. It looks like it wouldn't be hard to pry one out.

>pry diamond with screwdriver
I only understood you as far as wanting to pry the array of diamonds.

>pry diamond
You pry one of the diamonds out of the wall.

Thallium giggles. "Oh, I hope you're not disappointed, Jones."

>x diamond
(the diamond)

Jones: "Hmm. This is made of glass."

Thallium: "Poor, sad Jones. But here's the thing. There is a real diamond in there; it's just you'll never find it before the building's defenses flood the whole floor with poisonous gas. Or maybe I'm bluffing. Maybe I'm not. Can you afford to gamble?"

Jones tosses the fake away.

>pry diamond
That can't be pried out.

>x diamonds
It's impossible to tell which ones are real and which are glass without prying each one out separately.

>pry diamond
That can't be pried out.

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. Thallium's personal insignia, the ten planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam", is carved into the deep red wood outer wall, and inlaid with ebony. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something.

Galaxy Jones is in the eastern corner of the penthouse. This is apparently an office. A huge desk constructed of bubinga wood and carved in intricate patterns sits before the panoramic window. Video screens, currently displaying Thallium's logo, line the walls. Jones can go northwest or southwest.

>x window
Looking down at New Reykjavik, one can trace the history of the city, as it expanded radially from its original domes, the multiple frontiers colliding and interfering like ripples in a pond, until eventually, the map gave way to rectangular regularity. The Viking Building stands near the periphery, overlooking the vast red plain of Utopia Planitia.

>shoot window
Jones only uses violent means when absolutely necessary.

>x screens
They are showing Thallium's logo, the ten planets in order overlaid with the motto "Planetas Vincam".

They hit the diamond and join into a single more powerful beam that strikes the electronic eye on the wall.

Thallium's voice startles Jones, and she forgets the button for a moment.

"Yes, yes, press it!", Thallium squeaks.

Jones presses the red button, but nothing seems to happen. After a few seconds, however, she starts to feel light-headed, and shortly after she starts to suffocate. It's not a nice way to die.

Thallium's voice is thick with feigned concern. "Oh, my poor, poor Galaxy Jones. And you were so close."

Galaxy Jones is in the northern corner of the penthouse. This is Thallium's bedroom. Apart from the expansive round bed in the center of the room, notable features include the line of dummies displaying his various suits of clothes, a large vanity table, and the complete lack of mirrors on the ceiling, thankfully. One may leave the room to the southwest, south, and southeast.

Galaxy Jones is in the eastern corner of the penthouse. This is apparently an office. A huge desk constructed of bubinga wood and carved in intricate patterns sits before the panoramic window. Video screens, currently displaying Thallium's logo, line the walls. Jones can go northwest or southwest.

Galaxy Jones is in the southern corner of the penthouse. This must be Thallium's "treasure room", to go by the obscene display of wealth. The most notable feature is the array of diamonds lining the walls. Everything else here pales in comparison. Broken glass litters the floor. The penthouse continues to the northwest, north, and northeast.

Galaxy Jones is in the western corner of the penthouse. The purpose of this room is unclear. Instead of the black carpet that plagues the rest of the penthouse, the floor is fashioned from a striking polished red granite. Instead of windows, there are walls. A control panel is set into the outer wall. In the center of the room is a thin metal pillar ending in a claw, which looks like it's meant to hold something. Finally, there is something that looks like an electronic eye set into the inner wall. One may leave to the northeast or southeast.

Galaxy Jones is in the 100th floor elevator hall. The luxury is staggering.  The walls are made of polished black marble, and the floors are covered in plush black carpeting that muffles the sound of footsteps. The ceiling is high and adorned with a crystal chandelier. The elevator doors to the west are gold-plated. Sumptuous living quarters are visible to the north and south.

A portion of the eastern wall has slid away to reveal a stunning white marble staircase.

Jones: "Must be the way up to the roof. Beck, you there?"

Beck: "Yep, I'm here, just a bit busy is all. I'll meet you on that roof."

Jones walks out onto the luxurious penthouse roof. Admiral Thallium turns from the railing to face her. He is dressed in an absurd elaboration of a Martian Admiral's uniform. He looks Jones up and down with a lecherous leer. "Ah, Galaxy Jones, as lovely as ever. If it weren't so unbearably cliché I'd ask you to join me in my rise to greatness. But alas, you are too habituated to the smug high of 'goodness'." He sighs dramatically. "We've trodden similar ground before; no need to discuss it further. Although I would challenge any of your various amoureux to conjugate 'tread' correctly.

"Anyway, I guess this is the time where you do something predictably undignified and violent. Before you do I feel I should inform you that your sidearm has been rendered quite ineffective by my personal security field. But do go ahead and try it."

Jones sneers. "I wouldn't give you the satisfaction," she says, looking around. "I see you don't have any of your robot pets up here. How are you going to stop me from rescuing Europa?"

"Oh please, while we're trying things, try that too. I wish you luck breaking the silnium bars of the cage."

"What's silnium?"

"A superstrong material invented here in my Martian Chemical laboratory. We had a press conference for it -- weren't you watching?"

"Couldn't be bothered."

"Oh for frotz sake, Jones, you're so frustrating!"

Thallium turns his back on Jones and stares out over the city.

Galaxy Jones is on the penthouse roof. It is an extravagant and opulent space, designed to showcase Thallium's wealth and power. Much of the rooftop is devoted to an outdoor lounge area, with comfortable seating and a fire pit, centered around a hot tub and flanked by a bar. All around is the city of New Reykjavik, and beyond that the red Martian landscape. Around the entirety of the roof is an electrostatic field designed to keep air in and particulates out. To the north is a large cage, and to the west is a landing pad. Jones can distantly see a woman lying on the floor of the cage. A green and black flyer sits on the landing pad.

Admiral Thallium is sulking.

Thallium trails after Jones.

Um, Jones -- that harlot you're so bent on freeing from captivity is over there. Now get out of the way, I'm trying to escape."

Thallium pushes past Jones. She attempts to grab his shoulder, but she is thrown back by an unseen force.

Thallium smirks. "Personal security field, remember? Now I must be off."

Jones watches as Thallium boards the flyer. It takes off a moment later.

Galaxy Jones is on the flyer pad. This is what one would expect from a rooftop flyer pad: landing lights surrounding a large letter F painted in white on a red background. Europa's cage is to the northeast and the rest of the rooftop is to the east.

>x cage

Galaxy Jones is next to the cage. The closely-set silnium bars seem to dash all hope of a rescue. The flyer pad is to the southwest and the rest of the rooftop to the south.

Europa Callisto is lying at the center of the cage, out of Jones's reach.

Jones tries the strength of the bars just in case. They don't budge.

South of the cage, Thallium crosses the roof to the flyer pad, where he boards the waiting flyer. The flyer lifts off and moves towards Jones.

>attach hooks to bars
It doesn't seem useful to attach the cable to this part of the cage.

Thallium's flyer hovers over the rooftop. "Jones!"  he bellows. "Play time is over. I grow weary of your intransigence. In a moment this roof will be swarmed by guard robots -- of many different colors -- so many robots you couldn't possibly vandalize them all.  Say your prayers, Jones, or whatever you do when you're about to die."

Jones rolls her eyes.

A little ways off, another flyer, small and red, aims for the rooftop and accelerates.

>put hooks on cage
Jones puts the cable with hooks at either end on the cage.

>* && Why not allow attaching the cable to the bars?
I didn't understand that sentence.

Jones throws the cable up to the flyer where it hooks around the rail, and attaches the other end to the cage, then jumps off the cage to escape the aftermath. Seeing his flyer's predicament, Thallium jumps out of the craft and disappears below the edge of the roof. The flyer reaches the end of its tether and slingshots downwards, slamming into side of the building.

The cage has tilted to the side, one attachment torn loose from the rooftop. Jones crawls into the cage to see to Europa Callisto.

"Europa! Can you hear me? I need you to move to get out of this cage. I can't carry you through that small opening. Europa!"

Europa moans but doesn't show any signs of having understood Jones.

Galaxy Jones is in the cage. The whole structure is tilted, leaving a hole at the eastern end. The flyer pad is to the southwest and the rest of the rooftop to the south.

Jones is kneeling at Europa Callisto's side, trying to rouse her.

The red flyer, now recognizable as Galaxy's own, settles down onto the landing pad.

>wake europa
Europa moans but otherwise does not respond.

>pour water on europa
It's not elegant, but it works.

Jones opens the water bottle and brings it to Europa's lips. Even with closed eyes she drinks, first slowly and then with increasing vigor, until her eyes open.

"Ga- Galaxy Jones?" she says.

Jones nods, but says "We'll have time for introductions later. We have to get out of here before the roof is full of killer robots. Can you crawl? If you can get through that hole I can carry you the rest of the way."

Europa nods. "I think so."

Galaxy Jones helps her through the hole in the cage, then gently picks her up and jogs toward the waiting flyer. Beck's familiar face appears at the door of the aircraft, urging her on.

Not so far away, Admiral Thallium crawls back over the edge of the roof. As he pulls himself up, he aims a pistol at Jones's back...

The shot hits her full in the back and she falls sprawling on the landing pad, Europa Callisto tumbling from her arms. Beck is by Callisto's side in a moment, lifting her and carrying her into the flyer.

And then the robots swarm the roof like a mechanical rainbow tide. By the time Beck returns to the door it is already too late. A group of robots surrounds Jones, while another robot carries Thallium triumphantly. Beck has no choice but to take off, leaving Jones behind, not knowing if she still lives...

"Jones! Jones! Wake up! I'm trying to talk to you!"

<Cut to a shot of two closed eyes>

"C'mon, open those eyes."

<The shot widens to show Galaxy Jones, the Solar System's greatest hero, flat on the floor, seemingly unconscious>

"This is getting tiresome, Jones. Stop playing dead."

Her eyes flutter open, close again, then open. She winces and brings one hand up to shield her eyes. "Who's that?" she says, hoarsely.
