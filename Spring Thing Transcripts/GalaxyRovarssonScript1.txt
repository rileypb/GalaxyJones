Galaxy Jones is in the speeder dock. A safe harbor from the periodic dust storms of Utopia Planitia, the dock features several dozen speeder bays. Only a few are filled right now. The building entryway is to the north, under a red stone façade carved into the likeness of a fearsome Viking.

Jones's speeder, Galaxy One, sits in one of the parking bays.

>* && Hello, your friendly galactic playscripter here. I won't be going into full Test-Mode, but I thought a transcript might be welcome.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>* && Forst of all, the deep blue text in the prologue is very hard to read on dark background. I prefer dark on bright myself, but some people like it the other way.

Jones is carrying:
  a black jumpsuit (being worn)
  a disruptor pistol

It's an advanced Smart Suit, able to communicate sound, vision, and radar back to Beck at Galaxy Base. Also it has a neat light.

>turn on neat light

A compact instrument of death, with only one setting: kill.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x speeder
(the speeder)
Galaxy One is a Dust Runner, a top-of-the-line model from Olympus Speedworks. It's deep crimson with tinted windows. Powerful turbines adorn vestigial wings that sweep back in severe rearward arcs.

>x turbines
The engines cause Jones to recoil from the waves of heat rolling off of them.

>x wings
Not technically necessary as the speeder works via anti-gravity, the blade-like wings nonetheless give the vehicle a certain flair unobtainable by other means.

>s
Jones can't just leave Europa in the hands of Admiral Thallium!

>n
Jones approaches the Viking Building entryway, the dramatic façade towering over her.

Galaxy Jones is at the entry doorway. A glass revolving door leads into a large open space north of here. The speeder dock is to the south.

Jones looks up at the 100 stories of glass and steel. "What do you want to bet Thallium's got Europa all the way at the top?"

Beck: "Oh, no doubt."

>talk to jones
Jones's not likely to be helpful.

>*&& Yeah, A lone agent... I'm not going to be helpful to myself. I meant:
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Jones is already talking to Beck.

I didn't understand that sentence.

>n
Jones takes a deep breath. "I'm going in."

Beck replies, "You got this, Galaxy."

Jones passes through the revolving door and into the lobby, alert to any defenses.

Galaxy Jones is in the lobby. The ground floor of the Viking Building is breathtaking. Low-G architecture means more glass and thinner supports, and the building takes advantage of that. Four walls of glass surround a central pillar in which are set the utility rooms and elevators. In between is an expanse of plants, water features, and stylish seating. Near the entryway is a front desk. A giant crystal sculpture floats above the center of the area, suspended on almost invisible cables. She may go east and west from here, north to the elevators, or south out of the building.

>* && I like the message about the PC moving through the doors. The text would flow better if either "Jones" or "Galaxy jones" were replaced by "She" though.
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x lobby
Suddenly two robot guards, green and red, emerge from niches in the back wall! Jones dives behind the front desk and draws her disruptor pistol.

Jones shouts, "I'm under fire from two ugly robot things!"

Beck responds, "Monitoring your suit radar."

>* && Hmm... could I get that statue swinging?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>shoot cables
Jones fires the disruptor into the sculpture's main support cable, snapping it. The huge crystal blob starts to sag, straining the other cables. In quick succession they break as well, and the whole installation plummets to the ground, right on top of the hapless guard robots.

Jones's shot goes wide, reflecting off one of the building struts and into the suspended sculpture. The artwork begins to spin wildly, straining its cables.

Jones: "I could use some ideas here!"

>x plants
The ground floor is huge and made for holding people comfortably. Thus the hundreds of seats amidst Earth pleasures such as water and living green plants.

Beck: "Robot on your right!"

One robot tries to flank Jones, but a shot from her disruptor sends it scurrying back.

Zip! Disruptor fire scorches a nearby couch.

The robots intone "Destroy Jones" in an eerie drone.

It's a huge crystal abstraction, provocative in its arrogance but evocative of nothing. A typical public installation by the artist Rambutan. It's held up by metal cables.

Beck: "How's it going in there?"

"Jones: "You know -- like all art, it's hit or miss."

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
